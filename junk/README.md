# Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn

![Iris Classifier](/images/example_chart.png "Iris Dataset Classification")

Here you'll find a collection of follow-along files for machine learning with scikit-learn, all of which run in google colaboratory. These files are created by me, Michael Smirnov, and much of the content is based on the book "Hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow"

These files are meant to be consumed in the following order -

1. kaggle_titanic_prediction
2. multiclass_classification_decision_boundaries
3. svm_and_nonlinear_classification
4. ensemble_learning
5. unsupervised_learning
6. unsupervised_learning_2_images
