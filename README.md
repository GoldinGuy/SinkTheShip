# Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn

Here you'll find a collection of follow-along files for machine learning with scikit-learn, all of which run in google colaboratory. These files are created by me, Michael Smirnov, and much of the content is based on the book "Hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow"

Find more descriptions of the material, along with other tips and tricks, at my blog here:
